# # Web Development Project

# This web development project involved building a website –a basic clone of the Google Search webpage and an additional linked personal webpage– using HTML and CSS. 
# 
# HTML is used to create the structure and content of the website, and CSS is used to style it and make it look attractive. The HTML  includes elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. The CSS is used to create the layout of the website, as well as to style the text, background, and other visual aspects. After the HTML and CSS were  written, the website was tested to make sure it looks and functions correctly. 

# ## CSS File

# In the css file, I used selectors to apply styling to different elements on my webpage. I used selectors such as classes, ids, and tag names to target specific elements on the page. I then used a variety of properties such as font-family, font-size, background-color, and color to style the elements. I also used the box model to adjust the size and position of my elements, as well as the display property to control the visibility of my elements. Additionally, I used media queries to create a responsive design for different screen sizes.

# ## HTML File

# With this HTML code, I created a simple website with a menu, a search bar, and a profile picture, similar to the Google Search page. The code is made up of tags, which are HTML elements that are used to define the structure and content of a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angled brackets, like <div> or <head>. IDs are used to identify specific tags and give them unique names so that they can be referred to in the CSS code. IDs are indicated by the keyword "id" followed by an equal sign and the id name, such as id="menu" or id="search-bar".

# After this project, I learned that HTML and CSS are powerful tools for creating dynamic web content. I now understand how to build a website from the ground up, from planning the layout to styling it with CSS. This project has shown me that with a good understanding of these programming languages, I can create a unique, attractive website that meets the needs of the user.
